# GTMap Guide

This guide complements the generated API docs in `docs/api/`.
It explains the concepts, shows typical flows, and links you to the
relevant API types when you need details.

- Getting Started: basic setup and view controls
- Events: how to subscribe and what payloads look like (including load/resize)
- Markers: create, move, style, and listen to events
- Layers: group, show/hide, and observe entities
- Vectors: add simple geometry overlays
- Cookbook: small, practical snippets

For full signatures and types, open `docs/api/index.html`.
