# GTMap Guide

This guide complements the generated API docs in `docs/api/`.
It explains the concepts, shows typical flows, and links you to the
relevant API types when you need details.

- Getting Started: basic setup and view controls
- Transitions: chainable builder with single-commit apply
- Map Object: properties, methods, and options
- Events: how to subscribe and what payloads look like (including load/resize)
- Markers: create, move, style, and listen to events
- Layers: group, show/hide, and observe entities
- Vectors: add simple geometry overlays
- Cookbook: small, practical snippets
 - Migration: Leaflet → GTMap (pixel CRS)

For full signatures and types, open the API reference at `docs/api/` — start with [`docs/api/README.md`](../api/README.md) or jump directly to [`GTMap`](../api/Class.GTMap.md).

See also: [Leaflet → GTMap Migration](./migrate-from-leaflet.md) for a concise, code-focused migration guide.
